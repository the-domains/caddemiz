  Our boulevard has no beginning and no end, and it’s teeming with culturally
  rich and rooted

  inspiration, but its residents—a neighborhood literary and visual artists—are
  moved by humanism and novelty. No borders or boundaries limit whom we speak
  to, who hears us. Caddemiz is just one lighted slice, one fluid moment scored
  with branching trajectories, where arts happen. We'll begin with glimpses of
  Turkish

  fiction and poetry in the English language.
