Our street might appear antiquated and quiet, but listen: this imagined and imaginative space is full of life, ideas, character, and exchanges. Our street is teeming with culturally rich and rooted inspiration, but its residents are moved by difference and humanism, and therefore our street recognizes no national boundaries that can limit whom we speak to, who hears us. This is one slice, one fluid moment and open-ended trajectory, where literary arts happen. We'll begin with glimpses of Turkish fiction and poetry in the English language.
