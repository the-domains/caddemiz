  Our boulevard is rich in culture and inspiration, but our residents share
  story freely, graciously, and with courage. That's because at the core of
  literary craft, we share humanism. No borders may limit our scope, no
  oppressive force may stifle our opinions, because anonymity may be opted and
  reversed at a safer time. Caddemiz is just one lighted, fluid moment where
  arts happen. If we must say "Let's begin," then let's begin our stroll with
  Turkish poets and see where that takes us. Call for entries: Türkçe şiir
