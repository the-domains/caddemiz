  Our boulevard is rich in culture and inspiration, but our residents share
  story freely, graciously, and with courage. At the core of literary craft,
  we're humanists. No border may limit our scope, no force may stifle our
  voices; anonymity may be opted and reversed in safer times. Caddemiz is one of
  many lighted, fluid moments where arts happen. Let's begin with Turkish poets
  and see where that takes us. Call for entries: Türkçe şiir İngilizceye
  çevrilmiş gönderin lütfen.
