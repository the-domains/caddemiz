  Our boulevard has no beginning and no end, and it’s teeming with culturally
  rich and rooted inspiration, but its residents—a neighborhood literary and
  visual artists—are moved by humanism and novelty. No borders or boundaries
  limit whom we speak to, who hears us. Caddemiz is just one lighted slice, one
  fluid moment scored with branching trajectories, where arts happen. Let's
  begin a walk with Turkish poets and see where that takes us. Call for entries:
